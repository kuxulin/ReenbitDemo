I doubled code for login and register page in order to make further expanding more easy. When i need more complicated logic with jwt auth i will expand login and register components making them more different.
I understand that duplicate code is a bad practice)

project was created in a 27 hours

doesnt work locally from the same browser because of localstorage logic, but was tested with two separate devices
